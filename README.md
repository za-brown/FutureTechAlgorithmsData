# FutureTechAlgorithmsData
This repository (will) host code for obtaining the datasets that are associated with the AlgorithmsWiki project and the Algorithms in Use project.

You can expect examples of the datasets to be available imminently.

Datasets are (should be) stored as CSV files in the FutureTech shared Google Drive, accessible here:
